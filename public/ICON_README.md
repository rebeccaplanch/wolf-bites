# PWA Icons Setup

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: Use the SVG file
1. Open `public/icon.svg` in a design tool (Figma, Illustrator, etc.)
2. Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
3. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in the `public/` directory

### Option 2: Use an online tool
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload `public/icon.svg` or create a new icon
3. Download the generated icons
4. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in the `public/` directory

### Option 3: Use the HTML generator
1. Open `public/generate-icons.html` in a browser
2. Right-click each canvas and "Save image as..."
3. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

## Icon Design Guidelines
- Use NC State red (#CC0000) as the background
- Keep text/icons simple and readable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Use rounded corners (recommended)

Once the icons are in place, the PWA will be fully functional!
